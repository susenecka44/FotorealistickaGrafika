# Topic08 - Acceleration
* Implement some **acceleration method** for ray-scene intersection
  * *scene division* (BVH - R-tree)
  * *3D space division* (KD-tree, Octree)
* Acceleration of **triangle mesh** object[s] is recommended
  * large set of small spheres is suitable as well (e.g. particle system)

## Notes
* Build your acceleration data structure in **preprocessing stage**
  (see [parallelism](../06-Parallelism/README.md))
* Most advanced solutions should use some form of **tree optimisation**
  (e.g."SAH heuristics")

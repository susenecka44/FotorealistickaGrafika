# Step03 - Raster image output
* Your program should create an HDR raster image with the given
  resolution and write it to a disk file – PFM and Radiance HDR
  formats are available in the pilot project [/src/rt004](../src/rt004)
* Implement any **"non-trivial"** image content (e.g. defined by a formula).
  Any images based on simple patterns, goniometry, etc. will suffice
* Please test your **command-line/config parameters**, try to modify
  the image resolution and content

# Checkpoint 1
Send me the URL of your repository, I'll give it a try (access, compile,
run, check the HDR image). I'll also try to modify your config file...

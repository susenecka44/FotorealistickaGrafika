# Topic07 - Sky
* Implement some interesting **sky-dome** function for your ray-tracer
  * clear sky (see some sky-dome models)
  * cloudy sky (simple turbulence-baased texture can be used)
  * night sky with stars (stochastic distribution) and moon
* Substitute **background color** (see the `shade()` function) by your sky function

## Notes
* Use **deterministic approaches** if possible (see [parallelism](../06-Parallelism/README.md))
  * mandatory for simulation of continuous phenomena (clouds)
* Keep in mind that stars have to be simulated like non-zero area objects. The star's
  magnitude must have an effect on the area and the intensity of the star's image
* Be inspired by references below, but don't restrict yourself, you can find more results
  online...

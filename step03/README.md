# Step03 - Raster image output
* Your program should create an HDR raster image with the given
  resolution and write it to a disk file – PFM and Radiance HDR
  formats are available in the
  [project template](../src)
* Implement any "non-trivial" image content (e.g. defined by a formula)
  – please test your command-line/config parameters, try to modify
  the image resolution and content
* **Checkpoint 1** - send me an URL of your repository, I'll check
  it (access, compile, run, HDR image). I'll try to modify your
  config file as well.
